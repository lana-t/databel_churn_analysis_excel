## Key Insights

- **Top churn driver**: Customers leaving for competitors
- **Unlimited data plans** are causing dissatisfaction among low-data users
- **Early churn** is common — many customers leave within the first year
- **Contract type** strongly correlates with retention; longer contracts = lower churn

<br/>

## Recommendations

- **Introduce more competitive contracts**: Use price matching and improved offers to reduce competitor churn.
- **Offer a limited data plan**: Provide a cost-effective option for low-usage customers.
- **Enhance early retention**: Improve onboarding and introduce incentives for long-term contracts.

<br/>

## Business Impact

This analysis enables Databel’s executives to:
- Address **top churn causes** (e.g., competitor switching, poor plan fit)
- Design **targeted retention strategies**
- **Improve product-market fit** for data plans
- **Reduce churn** and **increase customer lifetime value**
